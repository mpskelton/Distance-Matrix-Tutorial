# Tutorial on Matching Cities using a Distance Matrix

## Overview
This repository contains all of the materials for the creation of and implementation of my tutorial on using a distance matrix to match location-level data. A general description of each folder can be found below, and my final written tutorial is in the file [`index.md`](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/blob/master/index.md).

## [Challenge](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/challenge)
This folder contains the files necessary to complete the challenge at the end of my tutorial. The instructions and guidelines for the challenge can be found in the challenge section of the tutorial, but the two data sets and answer key for the challenge are found here.
- `answer_key.R`
- `mass_cities1.csv`
- `mass_cities2.csv`

## [Data](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/data)
This folder contains all of the data used to create the tutorial and the licenses for any data taken from an online source. More details on the contents of the folder can be found in the folder's README, but the data used by `1_databuilding.R` can be found in the `data` folder and the data used to complete the tutorial can be found within the folder `practice_data` which is inside the `data` folder.

## [Extra Figures](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/extra%20figures)
This folder contains any supplementary figures used for the tutorial that are not generated by script. The contents are two screenshots of a matrix and a data frame in the `R` viewer and two diagrams of a distance matrix and the distance formula, used as a visual aid in the tutorial.

- `Euclidean_distance_2d.svg`
- `Screenshot_distmatrix.png`
- `Screenshot_newmatches.png`

## [Instructions](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/instructions)
This folder contains the original instructions for the tutorial assignment as well as the tutorial template referenced in the [Transferring Quantitative Skills Among Scientists](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/#publish) tutorial.

## [Notes](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/notes)
This folder contains a markdown document that contains all of the notes I made in preparation for starting the tutorial. It is not exhaustive but features my first thoughts on the project before I started collecting my ideas in scripts.

## [Outputs](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/outputs)
This folder contains all of the outputs made by `2_placematching.R`. There are two images of the distance matrix and three `.csv` files that contain the partial merges of the data sets used by the tutorial and the fully merged file.
- `pixel_mat_1.png`
- `pixel_mat_2.png`
- `place_fullmerge.csv`
- `place_matrixmatch.csv`
- `place_perfmatch.csv`

## [Scripts](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/tree/master/scripts)
This folder contains the scripts used to create and complete the tutorial. This folder has two scripts:
- `1_databuilding.R`
- `2_placematching.R`

More info can be found in the folder's README.

## [Feedback](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-mpskelton/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
The feedback I received on this tutorial can be found in a closed issue in the issues section of this repository, linked above.
