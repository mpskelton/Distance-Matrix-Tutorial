# Data
This folder contains all of the data used to create the tutorial. The data that is stored in the general `Data` folder are any files used by myself to generate the tutorial data sets but not used in the tutorial itself. The data sets used by the tutorial are found in the folder `practice_data`.

### Contents
#### Data
- `coords_alt.csv`
- `coords.csv`
- `HP_Places.csv`
- `License for HP Data.md`
- `license_uscities.txt`
- `uscities.csv`

Two of these data sets `HP_Places.csv` and `uscities.csv` were taken from online sources, so their licenses are also stored in this folder. Both data sets can be used, as long as their sources are cited and licenses are included with the project.

#### Practice Data
- `placecat_coords.csv`
- `placeid_coords.csv`
